Introduction
------------

``Optical tweezer tools`` is a python package for data analysis of optical tweezer experiments. As of now, it consists of tools for:

* Beam calibration
* Force and displacement measurements
* Simulating tweezer data
* Extraction of data from recorded footage *(will be added shortly)*
* Data visualisation

and some other bits of code that users working with optical trap equipment may find useful. Care has been taken that the included routines can be used in a modular way, although a simple pipeline for hassle-free data handling is provided.

Given a set of raw experimental data, the aim is to provide a simple environment in which users can extract the relevant parameters and perform analysis on them, for example examining the time-dependence of particles' displacements and forces acting on them.

.. note::
    Some of the functionality and documentation is still being worked on, so details in implementation may vary between versions.
